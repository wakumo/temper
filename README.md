### POST /api/v1/simulate

Simulates a single transaction against a local EVM.

[See the full request and response types below.](#types)

  "gasLimit": 500000,
  "value": "100000",
  "blockNumber": 16784600
}
```

Example response:

```json
{
  "gasUsed": 214622,
  "blockNumber": 16784600,
  "success": true,
  "trace": { ... },
  "logs": [ ... ],
  "exitReason": "Return"
}
```

Notes:

- `blockNumber` can be omitted and the latest block will be used, however providing a `blockNumber` is recommended where possible to use the cache.

### POST /api/v1/simulate-bundle

Simulates a bundle of transactions.

The server first attempts to simulate every transaction through QuickNode. If any
transaction cannot be handled by QuickNode, the whole bundle falls back to the
local workflow and runs sequentially on the same fork, so later transactions can
observe state changes from earlier transactions.

[See the full request and response types below.](#types)

Example body:

```json

  {
    "chainId": 1,
    "from": "0xd8dA6BF26964aF9D7eEd9e03E53415D37aA96045",

    "gasLimit": 500000,
    "value": "100000",
    "blockNumber": 16784600
  }
]
```

Example response:

```json
[
  {
    "gasUsed": 214622,
    "blockNumber": 16784600,
    "success": true,
    "trace": [ ... ],
    "logs": [ ... ],
    "exitReason": "Return"
  }
]
```

Notes:

- The request body must contain at least one transaction.
- All transactions must use the same `chainId`.
- For local fallback, block numbers must be non-decreasing.

### POST /api/v1/simulate-stateful

Starts a warm simulation session backed by a reusable fork/EVM context.

This endpoint is intentionally warm-stateless: it reuses fork/session setup for performance, but simulated transaction effects are not committed between requests. Use it for repeated independent simulations against the same chain/block context, not for sequential flows where transaction N+1 must observe state changes from transaction N.

[See the full request and response types below.](#types)

Example body:

```json
[
  {
    "chainId": 1,
    "gasLimit": 500000,
    "blockNumber": 16784600
  }
]
```

Example response:

```json
[{
  "statefulSimulationId": "aeb708a5-81d7-4126-a0b5-0f2a78b3830e",
}]
```


### POST /api/v1/simulate-stateful/{statefulSimulationId}

Runs simulations against the warmed EVM session referred to by the UUID in the URL.

Simulation results are returned to the caller, but transaction state changes are not committed back into the session. For example, an approval simulation followed by a swap simulation will not make the swap observe the approval unless that allowance already exists in the fork state or is provided through `stateOverrides`.

[See the full request and response types below.](#types)

Example body:

```json
[
  {
    "chainId": 1,
    "from": "0xd8dA6BF26964aF9D7eEd9e03E53415D37aA96045",

    "gasLimit": 500000,
    "value": "100000",
    "blockNumber": 16784600
  }
]
```

Example response:

```json
[{
  "gasUsed": 214622,
  "blockNumber": 16784600,
  "success": true,
  "trace": { ... },
  "logs": [ ... ],
  "exitReason": "Return"
}]
```
Notes:

- `chainId` must be the same in all transactions.
- `blockNumber` can be included and incremented when a multi-block simulation is required, or omitted in all transactions to use latest.
- Transaction effects are not persisted between requests in this warm-stateless mode.


### DELETE /api/v1/simulate-stateful/{statefulSimulationId}

Ends a current stateful simulation, freeing associated memory.

[See the full request and response types below.](#types)

Example response:

```json
{
  "success": true
}
```



### Authentication

If you set an `API_KEY` environment variable then all calls to the API must be accompanied by a `X-API-KEY` header which contains this API Key.

## 🏃‍♂️ Running 🏃‍♂️

### Locally

Copy `.env.example` to `.env`, fill out required values and run:

```bash
$ cargo run
```

If you want the server to restart on any code changes run:

```bash
$ cargo watch -x run
```

## 🧪 Test 🧪

Run:

```bash
$ cargo test
```

### Manual Testing

`body.json` contains a simple request in the root of the project so once the API is running you can just run:

```bash
$ curl -H "Content-Type: application/json" --data @tests/body.json http://localhost:8080/api/v1/simulate
```

If you have `jq` installed, you can run this to see pretty traces:

```bash
$ curl -H "Content-Type: application/json" --data @tests/body.json http://localhost:8080/api/v1/simulate | jq -r ".formattedTrace"
```

## 🧭 Roadmap 🧭

- [x] Support any RPC endpoint, not just Alchemy
- [ ] Connect to local node via IPC
- [ ] Connect to local [reth](https://github.com/paradigmxyz/reth/) DB
- [ ] Reintroduce bundle simulation as a dedicated sequential feature if needed.
- [ ] Support more authentication methods
